## Coding Standards

1. **PSR Standards:**
    - Adhere to [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) for PHP
      code.

2. **Code Formatting:**
    - Utilize Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript and ESLint for linting. Run `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run format`
      before committing.

3. **Conventional Commits:**
    - Follow the [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) message format for commit
      messages.

4. **Documentation:**
    - Document all functions, methods, and classes using PHPDoc standards.

5. **Naming Conventions:**
    - Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
    - Follow Laravel's naming conventions for migrations, models, controllers, etc.

6. **Security Best Practices:**
    - Sanitize input data and use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    - Implement CSRF protection in forms.
    - Keep sensitive information secure, use Laravel's built-in encryption where necessary.

7. **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests for all critical functionality.
    - Ensure all tests pass before merging code.

8. **Dependency Management:**
    - Keep dependencies up-to-date. Regularly check for and install updates.
    - Clearly define and manage package versions in the `composer.json` file.

9. **Error Handling:**
    - Implement meaningful error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.
    - Log errors appropriately for debugging.

10. **Git Practices:**
    - Make small, focused commits. Each commit should represent a logical and complete change.
    - Use feature branches and create pull requests for all code changes.

11. **Performance:**
    - Optimize database queries and eager load relationships when necessary.
    - Profile code and address performance bottlenecks.

12. **Consistency:**
    - Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.
    - Regularly review and refactor code to keep it clean and organized.
